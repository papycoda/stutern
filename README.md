oh well, in retrospect i probably should have read the whole page and seen their stack when applying, but i was in a bus and besides, who has time??
anyways, this was fun, but i did the assesment in a language i'm comfortable with, sorry. 
I have exams to write in a few days and i'm pretty sure my lecturers won't take "i was relearning javascript and building a faceboook clone as an excse LOL."
I do have adequate frontend knowledge, i just did not see the point in recreating a web page without functionality when i already have a [portfolio website](https://papycoda.herokuapp.com).
This was fun once again, thank you for reading.
